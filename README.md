Algonquin MobileX4
===

This project contains the presentation I gave on February 21st, 2012 at Algonquin College during their MobileX4 day. As well it contains the full source code for the Android and PhoneGap Android projects I presented. If you download this source you should be able to import it into Eclipse and run without modification.
